DevOps Project
This project focuses on designing and implementing a DevOps pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for an e-commerce application built with four microservices: Order, Cart, User, and Product. Each microservice is Dockerized to enable independent deployment and functionality. The User service handles user authentication and management, the Product service manages product listings and details, the Cart service facilitates adding and managing items in the shopping cart, and the Order service processes order placement and tracking. A Jenkins-managed CI/CD pipeline integrates with GitHub for automatic triggers and Docker Hub for storing Docker images, ensuring streamlined deployment with Docker Compose. The project documentation provides detailed architecture insights, deployment steps, testing strategies, and a summary of encountered challenges, equipping the team with experience in modern DevOps, microservices architecture, and CI/CD practices.
